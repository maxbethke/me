# me

## Description
This project is my self-promotional site that I made and maintain to
explain to potential customers, recruiters and friends what I do.
It should provide the visitor with a quick overview about me to help
them decide if they want to work with me or not.
It is the baseline of all my applications

## Ideas
Ideas are captured and managed in Notion. Once fully conceptualized, refined
and decided on, they are transferred to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/maxbethke/me/issues)
and from there will be implemented some day.
If you find any bugs, have ideas for features or suggestions for improvements,
please open a new Issue.

Before the 2022-06-29, I used to manage tickets for this project in Jira, so you might
not be able to find every ticket in the Issue tracker, especially not those from v1.0
